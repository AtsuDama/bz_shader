## Model
A simple model for BZ reaction has been proposed by A. Turner [1]. We assume that three chemical substances react following the chemical equations described below.

where _α_, _β_, and _γ_ denote the rate constants of the chemical reactions, respectively. The concentrations of the substances at _t_ + 1, _a_<sub>_t_+1</sub>, _b_<sub>_t_+1</sub>, and _c_<sub>_t_+1</sub> are expressed by those at _t_, _a_<sub>_t_</sub>, _b_<sub>_t_</sub>, and _c_<sub>_t_</sub>.
